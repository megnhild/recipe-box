FSJS Project: Recipe Box

This is an application that collects recipes because I'm tired of having to sift through my pins for my favorite recipes on Pinterest. It is designed to let users build their own digital recipe box. They can fill out the form to create/add recipes to their "box", mark specific recipes as a favorite, and delete recipes from the list. This is a CRUD application using the MEAN stack. Even though my project meets all four CRUD application requirements, I will be adding the feature to see the full recipe later.

Starting Recipe Box

1. make sure node is installed (I was using version 10.0.0)
2. make sure mongoDB is installed
After cloning the repository...
1. run 'npm install' to install necessary packages
2. run 'mongod' to start mongo service
3. run 'npm start' to start up the app's server
4. open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/

There are already a few recipes listed for you. Add a recipe to test the app! If you do not have a recipe in mind that you would like to add, below is a sample recipe you can use to test out the application. Enjoy!

Sample Entry

title: Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos

category: Appetizers

ingredients: 
20 whole jalapenos
2 8-ounce packages of cream cheese
1 pound of thin bacon (cut into thirds)

instructions: 
If you have them, slip on some latex gloves for the pepper prep... Cut jalapenos in half, length-wise. With a spoon, remove the seeds and white membrane (the source of the heat; leave a little if you like things HOT). Smear softened cream cheese into each jalapeno half. Wrap jalapeno with bacon pieces (1/3 slice). Secure by sticking toothpick through the middle. 

Bake on a pan with a rack in a 375-degree oven for 20-25 minutes. You don’t want the bacon to shrink so much it starts to the squeeze the jalapeno. If, after 20 minutes, the bacon doesn’t look brown enough, just turn on the broiler for a couple of minutes to finish it off. These are best when the jalapeno still has a bit of bite to it.

Serve immediately, or they’re also great at room temperature.
